# Jeff M. Clark's meme-based magic book
###### Uses NOPEname's Math Funtions (for cos/sin_lt): https://github.com/NOPEname/nn_math
## Currently underdevelopment
This data pack is currently in early development with only a few features, no full mutiplayer support and is incompatible with servers. In the future, I plan to add more spells, make them server and multiplayer compatible, make balance changes for pvp and anything that comes to my mind during development.\
